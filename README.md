## Abstract
<!-- Contains the purpose of the research carried out, the research questions that are dealt with, the research method and the most important findings -->

## Table of contents

## Introduction
<!-- An introductory chapter in which the purpose and design of the (sub)study is explained and in which the research questions are described -->

## Operationalization of the research questions
<!-- Describe the data that will be used and how the questions will be answered on the basis of this data. The data analysis itself is not yet described here. So do tell ‘Data file [X] comes from [Y] and can answer the posed questions because [Z]’, but do not yet describe the data itself -->

### Dataset analysis
<!-- Dataset is fully cleansed, visualized and analysed-->

### Machine learning models
<!-- More than three models applied and finetuned. If you choose for Regression, Association of Clustering, only one model is available. But you need that one apply a model with some set of parameters-->

## Results of the data analysis
<!-- Results of the data analysis: The actual answer of the research questions based on data analysis, the use of specific graphs to gain insight into the answers to the questions and the results of the hypothesis testing -->

### Model applications
<!-- R code is correct and well documented-->

### Model evaluation & improvements
<!-- Evaluation and improvement extensively done and elaborated-->

### Model comparison
<!-- Comparison (Ensemble) properly done and elaborated -->

## Conclusions and recommendations
<!-- including recommendations for further research -->
